It came to my attention that actually getting .msg files from Outlook
into Ubuntu was in fact a much more difficult task than expected, and
nothing currently is able to parse the data into something useful.

This should be a quick and dirty way to fix that. Want to have functionality
to first run this on one .msg file and turn it into a .txt file for ease
of data mining and other stuff. Added functionality will probably come
later.
